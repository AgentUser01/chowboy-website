export async function GET() {
  const posts = await getBlogPosts();
  
  const rss = `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<rss version="2.0">
  <channel>
    <title>Chowboy Blog</title>
    <link>https://chowboy.io/blog/</link>
    <description>AI-powered cooking tips and recipe management</description>
    ${posts.map(post => `
      <item>
        <title>${post.title}</title>
        <link>https://chowboy.io/blog/${post.slug}/</link>
        <description>${post.description}</description>
        <pubDate>${new Date(post.date).toUTCString()}</pubDate>
      </item>
    `).join('')}
  </channel>
</rss>`;

    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/xml',
    },
  });
}
```

// components/blog/TableOfContents.tsx
export function TableOfContents({ headings }) {
  return (
    <nav className="toc">
      <h3>Table of Contents</h3>
      <ul>
        {headings.map(h => (
          <li key={h.id}>
            <a href={`#${h.id}`}>{h.text}</a>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </nav>
  );
}
```

#### 3. **Implement HowTo Schema on Instructional Posts**

    {
      name: "Find a recipe on Instagram",
      text: "Browse Instagram and find a recipe post you like",
    },
