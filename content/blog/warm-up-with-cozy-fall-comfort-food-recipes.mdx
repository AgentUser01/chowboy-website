## Sweet Treats: Fall Desserts to Indulge In

### Classic Apple Pie

No fall is complete without the sweet aroma of apple pie wafting through the air. This classic dessert is a must-have during the autumn months.

- **Ingredients:**
  - 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
  - 1 teaspoon salt
  - 1 teaspoon sugar
  - 1 cup unsalted butter, cold and cubed
  - 6 to 8 tablespoons ice water
  - 6 cups thinly sliced apples (a mix of Granny Smith and Honeycrisp works well)
  - 3/4 cup sugar
  - 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
  - 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
  - 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
  - 1 tablespoon lemon juice
  - 1 egg, beaten (for egg wash)

- **Instructions:**
  1. Start by making the pie crust. In a large bowl, mix together the flour, salt, and sugar. Add the butter and use a pastry cutter to blend until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add ice water, stirring until the dough comes together. Divide the dough in half, form into discs, and chill for at least 1 hour.
  2. Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C).
  3. Roll out one disc of dough and fit it into a 9-inch pie dish. In a large bowl, combine the sliced apples, sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and lemon juice. Pour the apple mixture into the pie crust.
  4. Roll out the second disc of dough and lay it over the filling. Trim and crimp the edges to seal. Cut slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape. Brush the crust with the beaten egg.
  5. Bake in the preheated oven for 45-50 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling. 

### Pumpkin Spice Latte Cupcakes

  - 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
  - 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg

  - 1/2 cup pumpkin puree
  - 1/2 cup sugar
  - 1/2 cup brown sugar
  - 1/2 cup vegetable oil
  - 2 large eggs
  - 1/4 cup brewed espresso or strong coffee

- **Instructions:**
  1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a muffin tin with cupcake liners.
  2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and cloves.
  3. In a large bowl, combine the pumpkin puree, sugars, vegetable oil, eggs, and espresso. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix until just combined.
