  "instructions": [
    {
      "step": 1,
      "instruction": "On a clean work surface, pile the flour and make a well in the center. Add the eggs, salt, and olive oil (if using) into the well."
    },
    {
      "step": 2,
      "instruction": "Using a fork, gently whisk the eggs, gradually incorporating flour from the inner edge of the well."
    },
    {
      "step": 3,
      "instruction": "Once a shaggy dough forms, use your hands to incorporate the remaining flour until it comes together. Knead the dough for 8-10 minutes until it's smooth and elastic. It should spring back when poked."
    },
    {
      "step": 4,
      "instruction": "Wrap the dough tightly in plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours. This allows the gluten to relax, making it easier to roll."
    },
    {
      "step": 5,
      "instruction": "Divide the dough into 2-4 pieces. Flour your work surface and a rolling pin (or use a pasta machine)."
    },
    {
      "step": 6,
      "instruction": "Roll out each piece of dough to your desired thickness. For fettuccine or tagliatelle, aim for about 1-2mm thickness. If using a pasta machine, pass it through progressively thinner settings."
    },
    {
      "step": 7,
      "instruction": "Cut the pasta into your desired shape (e.g., fettuccine, tagliatelle, or squares for ravioli)."
    },
    {
      "step": 8,
      "instruction": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Add the fresh pasta and cook for 2-4 minutes, or until al dente. Fresh pasta cooks very quickly."
    },
    {
      "step": 9,
      "instruction": "Drain the pasta and toss immediately with your favorite sauce."
