- [ ] Firefox - Latest

## Deployment Instructions

### Option 1: Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)
```bash
cd /Users/taylorbrown/Documents/ChowboyTogether/chowboy-website

# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: website modernization - add animations, glassmorphism, social proof"

# Push to main (auto-deploys if connected to Vercel)
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Build and Deploy Manually
```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Test production build locally
npm start

# Deploy the /out folder to your host
```

---

## Analytics Setup (Important!)

After deployment, set up event tracking for:

### Exit Intent Modal
```javascript
// Track when modal is shown
gtag('event', 'exit_intent_shown', {
  'event_category': 'engagement'
});

// Track email submissions
gtag('event', 'exit_intent_submit', {
  'event_category': 'conversion',
  'event_label': email
});
```

### Floating CTA
```javascript
gtag('event', 'floating_cta_click', {
  'event_category': 'conversion',
  'event_label': 'download'
});
```

### Recipe Card Actions
```javascript
// Track save/share button clicks
gtag('event', 'recipe_action', {
  'event_category': 'engagement',
  'event_label': 'save' // or 'share'
});
```

---

## Email Integration (TODO)

The exit-intent modal currently logs emails to console. To capture emails:

### Option 1: Mailchimp
```typescript
// In ExitIntentModal.tsx, replace console.log with:
const response = await fetch('/api/subscribe', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ email }),
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
});
```

### Option 2: ConvertKit
```typescript
const response = await fetch('https://api.convertkit.com/v3/forms/YOUR_FORM_ID/subscribe', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    api_key: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVERTKIT_KEY,
    email: email
  })
});
```

---

## Fine-Tuning Recommendations

### After 1 Week, Review:
1. **Heatmaps** - See where users click
2. **Scroll Depth** - How far users scroll
3. **Modal Triggers** - Adjust exit-intent timing if needed
4. **Animation Speed** - Too fast/slow?

### Possible Adjustments:
```css
/* Slow down gradient if too distracting */
.hero-gradient-bg {
  animation: gradientShift 20s ease infinite; /* was 15s */
}

/* Adjust floating CTA appearance threshold */
setIsVisible(window.scrollY > 500); /* was 300 */

/* Change social proof timing */
setTimeout(() => { ... }, 5000); /* was 3000 */
```

## A/B Testing Ideas

Once live, test variations of:

1. **Hero Headlines**
   - Current: "Your recipes, organized & upgraded by AI"
   - Test: "Never lose a recipe again"
   - Test: "Import any recipe. Cook smarter."

2. **CTA Button Text**
   - Current: "Download Free 🚀"
   - Test: "Start Cooking Smarter"
   - Test: "Get Chowboy Free"

3. **Exit Intent Offer**
   - Current: "5 AI-generated recipes"
   - Test: "Weekly recipe newsletter"
   - Test: "Exclusive cooking tips"

4. **Testimonials**
   - Test different order
   - Test showing 3 vs 6
   - Test with/without badges

---

## Troubleshooting

### Gradient not animating?
- Check Safari compatibility
- Verify CSS is loading
- Check for console errors

### Glassmorphism not working?
- Safari needs `-webkit-backdrop-filter`
- Ensure element has background with alpha
- Check parent element isn't overflow:hidden

### Stats not counting?
- Must scroll to section (IntersectionObserver)
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify component is mounted

### Exit intent not triggering?
- Only triggers once (localStorage)
- Clear localStorage to test again
- Must move mouse to top edge
- Doesn't work on mobile (mouse-only)
