    {
      "amount": "2.0 lbs",
      "item": "Russet potatoes"
    },
    {
      "amount": "1.5 cups",
      "item": "All-purpose flour"
    },
    {
      "amount": "1.0 large",
      "item": "Egg (optional, for binding)"

      "amount": "0.2 teaspoon",
      "item": "Nutmeg (freshly grated)"

  "instructions": [
    {
      "step": 1,
      "instruction": "Wash the potatoes and boil them in their skins until very tender, about 20-30 minutes depending on size. Alternatively, bake them at 400°F (200°C) until tender, about 1 hour. Baking yields drier potatoes, which is ideal for gnocchi."
    },
    {
      "step": 2,
      "instruction": "Once cooked, peel the potatoes while they are still hot. Using a potato ricer or masher, press or mash the potatoes onto a clean work surface or a large bowl. Ensure there are no lumps."
    },
    {
      "step": 3,
      "instruction": "Spread the riced potatoes out to allow some of the steam to escape and cool slightly for about 5-10 minutes."
    },
    {
      "step": 4,
      "instruction": "Create a well in the center of the potatoes. Sprinkle about 1 cup of the all-purpose flour over the potatoes, along with the salt and nutmeg. If using, lightly beat the egg and pour it into the well."
    },
    {
      "step": 5,
      "instruction": "Gently work the ingredients together with your hands, bringing the flour from the outside into the center. Knead minimally until the mixture just comes together into a soft, pliable dough. Avoid overworking the dough, as this will make the gnocchi tough. It should be slightly tacky but not sticky."
    },
    {
      "step": 6,
      "instruction": "If the dough is too sticky, add more flour, a tablespoon at a time, until it's manageable. If it's too dry, add a few drops of water."
    },
    {
      "step": 7,
      "instruction": "Divide the dough into 4-6 equal portions. Roll each portion on a lightly floured surface into a long rope, about 3/4 inch (2 cm) thick."
    },
    {
      "step": 8,
      "instruction": "Using a knife or bench scraper, cut the ropes into 3/4 to 1-inch (2-2.5 cm) pieces."
    },
    {
      "step": 9,
      "instruction": "To shape the gnocchi, gently roll each piece over the tines of a fork or a gnocchi board, applying slight pressure with your thumb to create the traditional ridges. This helps them hold sauce. Dust with a little semolina flour as you go to prevent sticking."
    },
    {
      "step": 10,
      "instruction": "Place the shaped gnocchi on a lightly floured baking sheet or parchment paper, ensuring they don't touch, until ready to cook. You can freeze them at this stage on the baking sheet, then transfer to a bag once frozen solid."
    },
    {
      "step": 11,
      "instruction": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Gently drop the gnocchi into the boiling water in batches, being careful not to overcrowd the pot."
    },
    {
      "step": 12,
      "instruction": "The gnocchi are cooked when they float to the surface, which usually takes 2-4 minutes. Cook for an additional 30 seconds after they float to ensure they are cooked through."
    },
    {
      "step": 13,
      "instruction": "Remove the cooked gnocchi with a slotted spoon and transfer them directly into your prepared sauce or serve immediately with butter and cheese."
