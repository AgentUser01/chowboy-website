  "title": "Out-the-door Chia Power Doughnuts",
  "description": "This recipe is proof that not all doughnuts have to be the unhealthy kind. Packed with antioxidants, omega 3 fatty acids, protein, and fiber, these baked doughnuts will have you feeling ready to conquer your day (or just enjoy a Hike Light filling, and a bit crunchy, thanks to the generous amount of Chia seeds. I've added a decadent, but healthy, Coconut-Lemon Whipped Cream, but it's totally optional. The doughnuts are just as tasty served plain or spread with jam and nut butter. You be the judge.",
