    {
      "step": 1,
      "instruction": "Wash potatoes and boil them in their skins until very tender, about 20-30 minutes, depending on size. Alternatively, bake them until tender."
    },
    {
      "step": 2,
      "instruction": "Once cooked, peel the potatoes while they are still warm (but cool enough to handle)."
    },
    {
      "step": 3,
      "instruction": "Pass the warm potatoes through a potato ricer or mash them very finely with a fork or potato masher. Spread them out on a clean surface or a large baking sheet to allow some steam to escape and cool slightly for about 10 minutes."
    },
    {
      "step": 4,
      "instruction": "On a clean, floured work surface, pile the riced potatoes into a mound. Make a well in the center."
    },
    {
      "step": 5,
      "instruction": "Crack the egg into the well, add salt, and optional Parmesan cheese. Gradually add about 1 cup of the flour around the edges of the well."
    },
    {
      "step": 6,
      "instruction": "Using a fork, gently incorporate the egg and flour into the potatoes, then knead lightly until a soft, uniform dough forms. Add more flour, a little at a time, if the dough is too sticky, but avoid overworking it as this will result in tough gnocchi."
    },
    {
      "step": 7,
      "instruction": "Divide the dough into 4-6 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a log about 3/4 inch in diameter."
    },
    {
      "step": 8,
      "instruction": "Cut each log into 1-inch pieces to form the gnocchi. You can leave them as is, or for classic ridges, gently roll each piece over the tines of a fork or a gnocchi board."
    },
    {
      "step": 9,
      "instruction": "Dust the formed gnocchi lightly with flour and place them on a floured baking sheet, ensuring they don't touch each other to prevent sticking."
    },
    {
      "step": 10,
      "instruction": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Drop the gnocchi in batches (do not overcrowd the pot)."
    },
    {
      "step": 11,
      "instruction": "The gnocchi are cooked when they float to the surface. Let them cook for another 30 seconds to 1 minute after floating, then remove them with a slotted spoon."
    },
    {
      "step": 12,
      "instruction": "Serve immediately with your favorite sauce, such as pesto, marinara, or a butter and sage sauce."
